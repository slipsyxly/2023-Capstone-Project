a github repository for the capstone project assessment

Stage 1 EDA Details:
- The Stage 1 EDA directory was linked to a Google Drive folder where I downloaded the kaggle dataset via installing kaggle. This can be changed to fit other user's requirements.
- The code for the EDA will come in the form of a .ipynb file. It can be run using either Google Collab or PyCharm if you have the libraries installed.

Stage 2 PDA Details:
- A link to the teachable machine project will be included within this repository.

Stage 3 Deployment details:
- A .py file will be within this repository. It can be run using any Python environment that has the libraries installed.
- The Keras model and the labels text obtained in Stage 2 PDA have also been linked as it will be used to run the .py file.
- The test image path used is also linked in this repository as well.
